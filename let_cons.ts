// In the past we used the var keyword for every variable. ES5

//For example 

var name = 'jade'; //Bad practice today!
name = 'bob';

console.log(name);

// Now for ES6, we can use the let keyboard, which doesn't have the global scope 
// to avoid possible re assignations or unwanted assigns.

let anotherName = 'yeison';
anotherName = 'otherYeison';

console.log(anotherName)
